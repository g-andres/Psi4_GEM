DETCI TO-DO LIST
===============================================================

* olsengraph.cc and grapset.cc: make main calls to olsengraph() and graphset()
switch to CalcInfo.num_drc_orbs instead once available (catch both calls, one
for Alpha and one for Beta)
* Swap num_fzc_orbs in printing.cc line 326 for num_drc_orbs
* Switching ras_set2() such that the user must provide a guess for rstrdocc
and rstruocc (from process environment) and frozen_docc and frozen_uocc
will just be read from input (swaps the role of these two); means I'll
need to change transqt2 (probably nothing else)

Buffers bigger than 2E9 still don't work.  Known issues:
   o Calls to wreadw can't handle size > 2E9
   o vector.c contains lots of calls to be done on a per-buffer basis
     which allow only integer buffer sizes
   o need to finish converting to libpsio to avoid 2GB file pointer problem
     on Linux
